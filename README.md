# Speech-recognition-using-Tensorflow

SCOPE
The scope of the project to learn and understand TensorFlow and to use this open source software library for simple audio recognition. 

BACKGROUND
Audio recognition is used in a lot of applications such as Alexa, Ok Google, Siri and so on. 
TensorFlow an open source voice interface tool as released the Speech Commands Datasets. 
It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people.  
The challenge is to use TensorFlow and take advantage of TensorFlowâ€™s dataset to implement an algorithm for speech recognition.
	

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. 
It is Google Brain's second-generation system. Version 1.0.0 was released on February 11, 2017. 
While the reference implementation runs on single devices, TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs (with optional CUDA and SYCL extensions for general-purpose computing on graphics processing units).
TensorFlow is available on 64-bit Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile computing platforms including Android and iOS.


Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands.
