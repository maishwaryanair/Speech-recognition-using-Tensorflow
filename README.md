# Speech-recognition-using-Tensorflow

SCOPE
The scope of the project to learn and understand TensorFlow and to use this open source software library for simple audio recognition. 

BACKGROUND
Audio recognition is used in a lot of applications such as Alexa, Ok Google, Siri and so on. 
TensorFlow an open source voice interface tool as released the Speech Commands Datasets. 
It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people.  
The challenge is to use TensorFlow and take advantage of TensorFlowâ€™s dataset to implement an algorithm for speech recognition.
